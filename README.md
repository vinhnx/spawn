**spawn** A small command-line tool to quickly tryout a Swift Package Manager (SPM) package locally. 

As of Xcode 11, this has been sherlock'ed by Xcode 11 Package support :), as in from Xcode 11 onwards, Xcode will automatically resolve package dependencies and open Xcode project for you, no 3rd party tool needed. But I will keep this tool as learning purpose.

Its job is to check if current repo has any `Package.swift` and resolve dependencies and then open the Xcode for you.

(works with [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor), [too](https://github.com/vinhnx/spawn/blob/master/README.md#vapor))

```bash
$ spawn
Completed resolution in 0.22s
ðŸ“¦ ... Everything is already up-to-date
ðŸ›  ... generated: ./spawn.xcodeproj
ðŸ“‚ ... opening updated Xcode project
âœ… all done!
```

NOTE: you might want to close Xcode to have the `xed .` taking into effect, or chose `Revert` option from Xcode alert.

## Goals

When you want to try out or to edit a SPM package in Xcode, or after adding any new `.package` under SPM's package manifest file; you need to either run `swift package update` or `swift package generate-xcodeproj` and reload Xcode again.

This small wrapper aims to automate that process. 

tldr; before:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/vinhnx/DictionaryNestedSubscript # clone any Swift Package Manager project
$ cd DictionaryNestedSubscript # change directory to newly cloned repo
$ swift package update # update or resolve package dependencies
$ swift package generate-xcodeproj # generate a .xcodeproj to edit on Xcode
$ xed . # open generated .xcodeproj automatically
```

after:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/vinhnx/DictionaryNestedSubscript # clone any Swift Package Manager project
$ cd DictionaryNestedSubscript # change directory to newly cloned repo
$ spawn
```

TODO: I will be looking at the way to automate cloning from remote repo in the future, for example: 

```bash
$ spawn https://github.com/vinhnx/DictionaryNestedSubscript # not yet working
```

## Usage

On any Swift package directory, after `git clone`:

```bash
$ spawn
```

### Vapor

You can use spawn as replacement for Vapor's `vapor xcode -y` command

before:
```bash
$ vapor xcode -y
```

after:
```bash
$ spawn
```

## Related projects

If you like this tool, checkout my [vintage](https://github.com/vinhnx/vintage), it's a tool to check for any outdated packages.

Combo:

```bash
$ vintage && spawn # vintage: check for any outdated packages, spawn: generate and update packages for you
```

I hope you like it! :)
